# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Harmonica for Smooth Animation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Use the Harmonica library to animate entity movements for a smooth, non-flickering display.
# Details:
Replace direct position updates in the physics engine with Harmonica spring animations. The physics engine will set the target position, and Harmonica will handle the interpolation. Aim for a target frame rate of 30-60 FPS using a Bubble Tea `Tick` message.

# Test Strategy:
Visually compare the animation with and without Harmonica. The movement should be noticeably smoother. Monitor an FPS counter to ensure performance targets are met.
