# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Entity Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a polymorphic system to manage different types of simulation entities (Spheres, Sprites).
# Details:
Define an `Entity` interface and concrete structs for `Sphere` and `Sprite`. Each entity should have properties for position, velocity, size, color, and type. The main model should hold a slice of these entities.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for creating, adding, and removing entities from the manager. Verify that entity properties are correctly initialized.
