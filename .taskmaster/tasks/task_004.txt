# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create ASCII Rendering System for Entities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the rendering logic to display entities within the simulation pane.
# Details:
In the `View` method for the simulation pane, iterate through all entities and render them at their respective positions. Use 'O' or '‚óè' for spheres and custom characters for sprites. Apply colors using Lip Gloss based on entity properties.

# Test Strategy:
Add a few static entities to the model and verify they are rendered correctly in the simulation pane. Check if colors and characters match the entity properties.
