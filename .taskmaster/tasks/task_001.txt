# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Core Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Go project, set up dependencies (Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss), and implement the basic split-screen layout.
# Details:
Create a main Bubble Tea application with a model that defines a 70/30 vertical split for the simulation and control panes. Use Lip Gloss for styling the borders and layout. Ensure the layout is responsive to terminal resizing.

# Test Strategy:
Run the application and visually verify the split-screen layout. Resize the terminal window to confirm responsiveness. Check for clear borders between panes.
