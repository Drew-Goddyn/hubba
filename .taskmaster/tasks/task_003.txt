# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Basic Physics Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core physics logic for entity movement, including gravity and velocity.
# Details:
Create a physics package. In the application's `Update` loop, iterate through entities and apply a constant gravity force to their velocity. Update each entity's position based on its velocity. Implement boundary checks to keep entities within the simulation pane.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the physics calculations (e.g., applying gravity over time). Visually inspect the simulation to see if entities fall downwards and move according to their velocity.
