# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Collision Detection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add collision detection between entities and between entities and the simulation boundaries.
# Details:
Implement two types of collision: 1) Boundary collision, where entities bounce off the walls of the simulation pane. 2) Entity-entity collision, where entities bounce off each other, conserving momentum. Use Harmonica springs to create a bounce effect.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for collision detection logic. Visually test by creating multiple entities and observing their interactions with each other and the walls. They should bounce realistically.
