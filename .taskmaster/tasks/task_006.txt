# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Interactive Control Pane UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface in the control pane using the Bubbles library for components.
# Details:
Add interactive buttons for 'Add Sphere', 'Add Sprite', 'Clear All', 'Pause/Resume', and 'Reset'. Lay them out horizontally in the bottom 30% of the screen. This UI can be a separate Bubble Tea model.

# Test Strategy:
Visually inspect the control pane to ensure all buttons are present and correctly labeled. The application should not crash when interacting with the (currently non-functional) buttons.
