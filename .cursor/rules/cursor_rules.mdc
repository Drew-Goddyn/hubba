description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

- **Testing Standards:**
  - **Never give up on failing tests** - Always fix test failures, don't suggest leaving them "as-is"
  - **100% test pass rate is the goal** - Work through each failing test systematically
  - **Fix root causes, not just symptoms** - Understand why tests fail and fix the underlying issue
  - **Test failures indicate work is incomplete** - A task isn't done until all tests pass
  - **Update test expectations only when implementation is definitively correct** - Verify the implementation is right before changing test expectations
  
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Fix all failing tests
  go test -v  # Work through each failure systematically
  
  # ❌ DON'T: Give up on test failures
  # "80% pass rate is good enough" - NO! Fix them all!
  ```
